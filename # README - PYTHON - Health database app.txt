Creating a Python app that searches through 10 different health databases is a complex but exciting project! Here's a plan for developing this app, including a basic implementation.

Plan
Purpose: The app will allow users to query health-related information from multiple databases.
Databases: Use a mix of APIs or web scraping for health-related data, such as:
WHO API
CDC API
PubMed
DrugBank
OpenFDA
Health.gov
Mayo Clinic
WebMD
NIH
Medical News Today
Features:
Unified search bar
Real-time querying across all sources
Categorized and ranked results
Filters for relevance and date
Implementation:
Python libraries: requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, flask (for UI), and optionally SQLAlchemy for saving results.
API integration and handling rate limits.
Error handling for unavailable sources.
Basic Python App Code
Hereâ€™s a simplified implementation to query multiple health-related APIs.

python
Copy code
import requests

# Base URLs for mock APIs
DATABASES = {
    "WHO": "https://www.who.int/api/v1/search?q={query}",
    "CDC": "https://data.cdc.gov/resource/example.json?q={query}",
    "PubMed": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/api/v1/search?term={query}",
    # Add 7 more database APIs
}

def search_health_databases(query):
    results = {}
    for db_name, base_url in DATABASES.items():
        try:
            response = requests.get(base_url.format(query=query))
            if response.status_code == 200:
                results[db_name] = response.json()  # Assuming JSON response
            else:
                results[db_name] = f"Error {response.status_code}"
        except Exception as e:
            results[db_name] = f"Error: {str(e)}"
    return results

def display_results(results):
    for db, data in results.items():
        print(f"\nResults from {db}:\n")
        if isinstance(data, dict):  # If JSON
            for key, value in data.items():
                print(f"{key}: {value}")
        else:
            print(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_query = input("Enter your health-related query: ")
    search_results = search_health_databases(user_query)
    display_results(search_results)
Future Improvements
Flask UI:
Create a front-end using Flask with search input and result display.
Database Integration:
Store results in a database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) for easy retrieval.
Rate Limits:
Implement proper error handling and back-off strategies for API rate limits.
Data Filters:
Add filters for date, source, and relevance.
Challenges
Securing API keys for certain databases.
Handling inconsistent data formats from different APIs.
Managing rate limits for multiple queries.
